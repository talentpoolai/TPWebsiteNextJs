## **Difference between Onboarding and Orientation**

Contrary to popular belief, employee onboarding and orientation are not the same thing. They are distinct processes that are often used interchangeably, but they have different meanings.

Orientation refers to the process of familiarising new employees with the company's policies, procedures, and rules. It also includes introducing them to their colleagues and their workspace. It typically takes place on the first day or first few days of a new employee's tenure.

On the other hand, onboarding is a more comprehensive and longer-term process that goes beyond orientation. It encompasses the entire employee experience; from the time an employee accepts a job offer until they are completely integrated into the company. Onboarding includes orientation, but it also involves providing ongoing support and training. It assists new employees in learning their roles, understanding the organization's culture, and becoming more productive.
